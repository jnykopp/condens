* Condens.el

  Condense text with unicode ligatures!

  Having problem squeezing your thoughts in a 140 char tweet? No
  problem!  Just condens.el it!

  Example:

  The 16-character string "telephone gallup" turns into 11-character
  "℡e㏗one ㏿lup". (This may look ugly to you thanks to GitHub's
  unfortunate choice of font, but rest assured, it is glorious in
  Emacs!)

  Demo time!

  To achieve similar effect yourself just bind function ~condens-this~ to a
  key and ﬅ🜇t ㏊㎜er㏌g it!

  Note: Initial build of unicode ligature database may take a minute
  but it's done only once per Emacs-restart. Which happens once in a
  century, about.
